The initial idea is to create a game dev jourbey decision companion system.This will be a CLI project that helps user to make decision based on game development things like what engine should they choose,what skill they should learn,what game should they make..etc.<br>
The idea is that first user select mode such as what game engine should they choose,what game should they make next,what skill should they learn.
After that questions will be asked and decision is made according to the scoring system and user preferences and also reasoning will be provided.
